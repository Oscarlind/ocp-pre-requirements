== Bastion host

NOTE: This is only required if doing disconnected installations or to have a specific server for interacting with the cluster. 

.Bastion host specifications.

. On the bastion host we need an SSH key for the installation, or the
option to create one.
. A https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/nutanix/installer-provisioned[Pull Secret] for fetching the images required for the installation.

== Agent Based Installer

Using the Agent Based Installer for cluster deployments.
The Agent-based installation method provides the flexibility to boot your on-premises servers in any way that you choose by leveraging the Assisted Service.

ABI requires the following steps:

1. Downloading the Agent-Based Installer

2. Creating the preferred configuration inputs with network customizations for disconnected installation, dual-stack networking and other machine configuration (**install-config.yaml**, **agent-config.yaml** and other optional manifests)

3. Generating the bootable ISO image via the `openshift-install agent create image`

4. Hosting the bootable ISO image on an accessible web server

5. Booting the first installation host with the bootable ISO image.

6. Once the first installation host boots with the ISO image, the host will run the Assisted Service and continue the installation automatically.

The installation host can be booted via IPMI by using iDRAC and the Redfish standard with Dell's OEM extensions with the `idrac-virtualmedia://` protocol.

If booting virtualmedia via Redfish is not feasible, the Agent-Based Installer generates PXE assets and optional iPXE scripts via the `openshift-install agent create pxe-files` command, which can then be uploaded to where they will be accessible during the boot process.

NOTE: See the link:https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/installing/installing_with_agent_based_installer/installing-with-agent-based-installer.html[Red Hat OpenShift documentation on Agent-Based Installer] for more information.

=== Host Configurations
You can make additional configurations for each host on the cluster in the agent-config.yaml file, such as network configurations and root device hints.

NOTE: For each host you configure, you must provide the MAC address of an interface on the host to specify which host you are configuring.

==== Example agentconfig
```yaml
apiVersion: v1beta1
kind: AgentConfig
metadata:
  name: example-cluster
rendezvousIP: 192.168.111.80
hosts:
  - hostname: master-1
    role: master
    interfaces:
      - name: eno1
        macAddress: 00:ef:44:21:e6:a5
  - hostname: master-2
    role: master
    interfaces:
      - name: eno1
        macAddress: 00:ef:44:21:e6:a6
  - hostname: master-3
    role: master
    interfaces:
      - name: eno1
        macAddress: 00:ef:44:21:e6:a7
  - hostname: worker-1
    role: worker
    interfaces:
      - name: eno1
        macAddress: 00:ef:44:21:e6:a8
```
TIP: More complex network configurations such as bonds etc are also possible to define here.

IMPORTANT: While the Service and Pod Networks are internal, please
ensure that they do not overlap with external networks to avoid routing
issues. Both the number of Pods and Nodes in a cluster are dependent on
the hostPrefix. A default value of 23 with a pod CIDR of /14 will allow for 512 nodes and ~500
pods per node.

=== Image Registry 

At least 100 GB block storage is available for cluster internal registry if no file storage is available.

== Validation

The Agent-based Installer performs validation checks on user defined YAML files before the ISO is created. Once the validations are successful, the agent ISO is created.

=== Install-config.yaml

baremetal, vsphere and none platforms are supported.

The networkType parameter must be OVNKubernetes in the case of none platform.

apiVIPs and ingressVIPs parameters must be set for bare metal and vSphere platforms.

Some host-specific fields in the bare metal platform configuration that have equivalents in agent-config.yaml file are ignored. A warning message is logged if these fields are set.

=== agent-config.yaml

Each interface must have a defined MAC address. Additionally, all interfaces must have a different MAC address.

At least one interface must be defined for each host.

World Wide Name (WWN) vendor extensions are not supported in root device hints.

The role parameter in the host object must have a value of either master or worker.

== Misc 

NOTE: After installing the oc and openshift-install binaries, it is useful to set up (and source) the bash commands completion:

[source, bash]
----
[root@demo ~]# oc completion bash > /etc/bash_completion.d/openshift
[root@demo ~]# source /etc/bash_completion.d/openshift
