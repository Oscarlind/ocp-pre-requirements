= OpenShift AI Requirements

This file holds the prerequisites to deploy Red Hat OpenShift AI (RHOAI) on an OpenShift Container Platform (OCP) cluster.

[NOTE]
====
Please refer to the official documentation for more information: https://docs.redhat.com/en/documentation/red_hat_openshift_ai_self-managed/2.13/html-single/installing_and_uninstalling_openshift_ai_self-managed/index#installing-and-deploying-openshift-ai_install
====

== Git Repository

* Set up Git repositories for hosting RHOAI configurations.
* OpenShift Pipelines will be utilized for automating the building of custom Workbench images from a Git repository.

== OpenShift Container Platform Cluster

* **OpenShift Version:** OpenShift Container Platform 4.12 or later.
* **Worker Nodes:**
  * At least **2 worker nodes** dedicated for OpenShift AI workloads.
  * Each node should have:
    * **CPU:** Minimum of 8 CPUs.
    * **Memory:** Minimum of 32 GiB RAM.
* **GPU Support:**
  * GPUs are supported by Red Hat OpenShift AI.
  * configured to be available to the Red Hat OpenShift host worker nodes.
* **Storage:**
  * A StorageClass with dynamic provisioning should be configured.
  * Ensure sufficient storage capacity for AI workloads.
  * Customer has S3-compatible object storage that is accessible to the target OpenShift cluster.
* **OpenShift Components:**
  * Target OpenShift has the OpenShift internal image registry enabled.
  * OpenDataHub has **not** previously been installed on the target OpenShift cluster.
  * ServiceMesh has **not** previously been installed on the target OpenShift cluster.
  * Serverless has **not** previously been installed on the target OpenShift cluster.
* **Identity and Access Management:**
  * An identity provider configured for the OCP cluster.
  * Client has OpenShift OAuth and Group Sync configured.
  * `cluster-admin` access to the target OpenShift will be made available via a user or group.
* **TLS and Certificates:**
  * Target OpenShift has properly configured TLS certificates.
  * OpenShift is configured to trust certificates from external resources.

== Internet Access

The following domains must be accessible during the installation of OpenShift AI Self-Managed:

* `cdn.redhat.com`
* `subscription.rhn.redhat.com`
* `registry.access.redhat.com`
* `registry.redhat.io`
* `quay.io`

For CUDA-based images, the following domains must be accessible:

* `ngc.download.nvidia.cn`
* `developer.download.nvidia.com`
* `nvcr.io` 

== Additional Requirements

* **Network Configuration:**
  * All cluster nodes must be able to communicate over the network.
  * Configure DNS entries for API and application routes if necessary.
* **Load Balancer:**
  * If using external load balancers, ensure they are properly configured.
* **Subscriptions:**
  * Ensure you have valid Red Hat subscriptions for OpenShift AI and its components.



== Preparation Steps

1. **Update OpenShift Cluster:**
   * Apply the latest updates and patches to OCP.
2. **Verify Cluster Health:**
   * Run `oc get nodes` and ensure all nodes are in the `Ready` state.
   * Run `oc get clusteroperators` to ensure all operators are functioning correctly.
3. **Verify Components Not Installed:**
   * Ensure that OpenDataHub has **not** previously been installed on the target OpenShift cluster.
   * Ensure that ServiceMesh has **not** previously been installed on the target OpenShift cluster.
   * Ensure that Serverless has **not** previously been installed on the target OpenShift cluster.
