= Bastion host

Bastion host specifications.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Type |Requirement
|Operating System |RHEL8 (or greater)

|Hardware |2CPUs 8GB RAM

|Storage |120GB

|Internet |Access via proxy, list of
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.html[URLs].
|===

[arabic]
. On the bastion host we need an SSH key for the installation, or the
option to create one.
. The Nutanix root CA certificates needs to be added to the system
trust.
* Download from the Prism Central
* Extract the compressed file that contains the Nutanix root CA
certificates
* Add to the system trust
+
[source,bash]
----
   cp certs/lin/* /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
   update-ca-trust extract
----
+

IMPORTANT: The certificate needs to be signed by a CA, see
link:#nutanix-certificates[Nutanix Certificates]

. The OpenShift
https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/nutanix/installer-provisioned[Installer]
binary or the possibility to download it.
. A
https://console.redhat.com/openshift/install/nutanix/installer-provisioned[Pull
Secret] for fetching the images required for the installation.

== Nutanix Storage

Prerequisites for CSI Integration can be found here:

CSI Plugin Prerequisites]

Firewall requirements for the CSI Integration can be found here:

CSI Driver Firewall Configutation]

== Nutanix Certificates

The Nutanix environment needs to use a certificate signed by a CA.

More information can be found in the

= Cluster

== DNS

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|===
|Serial |Description |Entry |Type
|1 |API VIP DNS entry |api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> |A/AAAA or CNAME
|2 |Apps VIP DNS entry |*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> |A/AAAA or CNAME
|===


TIP: One API and one wildcard entry per cluster


== Cluster SSL Certificates

[width="100%",cols="25%,25%,25%,25%",options="header",]
|===
|Serial |Description |subjectAltName |Type
|1 |API Certificate |api.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> |Key and Cert (PEM format)
|2 |Wildcard Certificate |*.apps.<cluster_name>.<base_domain> |Key and Cert (PEM format)
|===

== Cluster Networks

[cols=",,",options="header",]
|===
|Serial |Description |CIDR
|1 |Node Network |[Machine CIDR]
|2 |Service Network |[Service CIDR]
|3 |Pod Network |[Pod CIDR]
|4 |Host Prefix |23
|===


IMPORTANT: While the Service and Pod Networks are internal, please
ensure that they do not overlap with external networks to avoid routing
issues. Both the number of Pods and Nodes in a cluster are dependent on
the hostPrefix. A default value of 23 with a pod CIDR of /14 will allow for 512 nodes and ~500
pods per node.


= Network

[width="99%",cols="20%,16%,16%,16%,16%,16%",options="header",]
|===
|Serial |Description |Source |Destination |Port |Protocol
|1 |DHCP Service available to hand out IPâ€™s and reachable from node
network |Node Network |DHCP |67, 68 |UDP

|2 |Lease period 8 hours or less |- |DHCP |- |-

|3 |NTP Service reachable from the node network |Node Network |NTP |123
|UDP

|4 |Cluster API access from Bastion host |Bastion host (Node network)
|API VIP |6443 |TCP

|5 |Outbound to repository source |Node Network | |443,22 |HTTPS, SSH

|6 |LDAP for Identity Authentication |Node Network |LDAP Servers |389
|LDAP

|7 |Web Console (1) |Workstation/VDI |APPS VIP |80/443 |HTTPS

|8 |DNS |Workstation/VDI |DNS Servers |53 |DNS
|===

____
. Only required if the workstation/VDI will be on a separate network
. All nodes must be in the same VLAN.
. The default gateway should be configured to use the DHCP server.

== Proxy details

[width="100%",cols="9%,26%,33%,32%",options="header",]
|===
|Serial |Type |Description |Value
|1 |HTTP Proxy |httpProxy value |[Replace with actual value]
|2 |HTTPS Proxy |httpsProxy value |[Replace with actual value]
|3 |No Proxy |noProxy value |[Replace with actual value]
|4 |Certificate Authority |CA Cert chain for the proxy |-

IMPORTANT: The Proxy object will use the link:#cluster-networks[Cluster
Networks] to populate the noProxy variable.

= Validation

The OpenShift installer does not validate the sanity of the DNS records,
network or DHCP etc while deploying a cluster. Its expected the
underlying required services are setup as per the requirements and they
work as expected. However, its easy to run into issues. Below are few of
the pointers that can help validate.

* Ensure there are no duplicates with regards to the link:#DNS[DNS
Entries].
+
[source,bash]
----
dig api.<cluster-name>.<base_domain>
----
* Ensure NTP, DHCP and DNS service is reachable from the Node Network.
+
[source,bash]
----
nc -vz <dhcp_server> 67
nc -vz <ntp_server> 123
----
* Ensure you can reach the `HTTPS/9440` port on Prism Central and Prism
Element from the Node network.
+
[source,bash]
----
nc -vz <prism_central> 9440
nc -vz <prism_element> 9440
----
* Ensure you can reach the Git server using HTTPS/SSH
+
[source,bash]
----
nc -zv <git_url> 443
nc -zv <git_url> 22
----
