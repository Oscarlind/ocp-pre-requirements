= Bastion host

Bastion host specifications.

[width="100%",cols="50%,50%",options="header",]
|===
|Type |Requirement
|Operating System |RHEL8 (or greater)

|Hardware |2CPUs 8GB RAM

|Storage |120GB

|Internet |Access via proxy, list of
https://docs.openshift.com/container-platform/4.14/installing/install_config/configuring-firewall.html[URLs].

[arabic]
. On the bastion host we need an SSH key for the installation, or the
option to create one.
. The VMware root CA certificates needs to be added to the system
trust.
* Download https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2108294[Certs] from the vCenter
* Extract the compressed file that contains the vCenter root CA certificates.
* Add to the system trust
+
[source,bash]
----
   cp certs/lin/* /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors
   update-ca-trust extract

. The OpenShift

binary or the possibility to download it.
. A

Secret] for fetching the images required for the installation.

|4 |Host Prefix |23
|===


IMPORTANT: While the Service and Pod Networks are internal, please
ensure that they do not overlap with external networks to avoid routing
issues. Both the number of Pods and Nodes in a cluster are dependent on
the hostPrefix. A default value of 23 with a pod CIDR of /14 will allow for 512 nodes and ~500
pods per node.

. Only required if the workstation/VDI will be on a separate network
. All nodes must be in the same VLAN.
. The default gateway should be configured to use the DHCP server.

= Validation

The OpenShift installer does not validate the sanity of the DNS records,
network or DHCP etc while deploying a cluster. Its expected the
underlying required services are setup as per the requirements and they
work as expected. However, its easy to run into issues. Below are few of
the pointers that can help validate.

* Ensure there are no duplicates with regards to the link:#DNS[DNS
Entries].
+
[source,bash]
----
dig api.<cluster-name>.<base_domain>
----
* Ensure NTP, DHCP and DNS service is reachable from the Node Network.
+
[source,bash]
----
nc -vz <dhcp_server> 67
nc -vz <ntp_server> 123
----
* Ensure you can reach the `+HTTPS/443+` port of the vCenter from
the Node Network
+
[source,bash]
----
nc -vz <vcenter_dns> 443

----
* Ensure you can reach the Git server using HTTPS/SSH
+
[source,bash]
----
nc -zv <git_url> 443
nc -zv <git_url> 22
